## Understanding Functional Programming in JavaScript

### Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features and development processes. Programming languages can adhere strictly to one paradigm, or they can be multi-paradigm. Each paradigm comes with it's on style, structure, benefits and trade offs.

The two most common programming paradigms and examples of each:

* Functional
    * Haskell
    * Elm
* Object Oriented
    * Java
    * Ruby
    * C#


### Functional Foundations

* Immutability
* Referential Transparency
* Composition
* Currying
* Functional Purtiy
    * No side effects
    * Same input generates same output
